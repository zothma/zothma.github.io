# zothma.github.io - Personal portfolio

This website is meant to show my projects, repositories and code ideas. It was created so people who need to have a look at my work can do it easily.

## Arch Journey

In this project, I create my own Arch system and share it. I will develop tools, create an interface, learn how to theme and rice. A whole part of the website is dedicated to the project.

## TODO
 - [ ] Create the website interface
 - [ ] Describe who I am and my projects
 - [ ] Create the Arch Journey dedicated part
 - [ ] Add my first articles
